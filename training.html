        <h1>Training</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>What is training?</h2>
        <!--insert image here-->
        <p>Our training is broken up into four distinct units: physical, mental, systems, and zero gravity. 
        In order to pass each unit, all future explorers must pass the unit test. After the completion of all
        training activities, future explorers must pass a comprehensive exam to gain flight clearance.</p>
        
        <h2>Physical Training</h2>
        <!--insert image here-->
        <p>During the physical training unit, future explorers will spend time exercising. Space travel is physically
        demanding, requiring the astronaut to stay in peak physical condition in order to carry necessary equipment. In addition,
        space is unpredictable. If for any reason the needs arises, explorers should be physically capable of doing
        any task required of them such as taking long spacewalks or carrying large amounts of equipment.</br>
        The physical unit test consists of a mile run, pushups, crunches, and a one hundred meter freestyle swim.</p>
        
        <h2>Mental Training</h2>
        <!--insert image here-->
        <p>Space requires astronauts to be quick on their feet, coming up with solutions in high-pressure situations. In order to ensure
        our explorers are up to the challenge, the mental stage of training teaches all future explorers about stress and various 
        coping mechanisms to help deal with it. Our mental training also teaches future explorers skills such as problem solving and 
        communication skills to help with the high-intensity of teamwork in space.</br>
        The mental unit test is a simulated problem in a spacecraft in which future explorers must figure out a way to solve their problem--
        and survive--before time and oxygen run out.</p>
        
        <h2>Systems Training</h2>
        <!--insert image here-->
        <p>The systems training unit is where future explorers learn about the equipment they will be using during their journey.
        Everything from space suits to the toilet requires a certain level of knowledge to operate. The systems unit focuses on
        spacesuits, landers, and rovers since these are the three pieces of equipment our future explorers will be using
        the most.</br>
        The systems training unit concludes with a comprehensive multiple choice test that ensures all astronauts
        have the knowledge necessary to operate their equipment safely and effectively.</p>
        
        <h2>Zero Gravity Training</h2>
        <!--insert image here-->
        <p>As most of our explorers time is spent in space, an environment with no gravity, our future explorers must be
        comfortable working in little to no gravity. Becuase gravity is present everywhere on Earth, our explorers train in water,
        a fluid that helps to simulate zero gravity environments. The unit exam for the zero gravity unit is a series of five exercises
        mimicing possile events in space, such as a crash landing or loss of pressure, completed over the course of three days.</p>
        
        <h2>Comprehensive Training Exam</h2>
        <p>The comprehensive exam consists of </p>
        
        <p>Once future explorers gain flight clearance through the comprehensive training exam, the skies—or rather the stars—are the limit!</p>
        
        <hr>
        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>If at any point during the training process a physical, mental, or other problem comes to light that will prevent a future explorer from
        safely completing training or carrying out a required task during the explorer's expidition, he or she will be removed from the program.
        Refunds are given on a case-by-case basis as the equipment already purchased for the explorer's journey varies.</p>

            <h2 class="heads">What is training?</h2>
            <!--insert image here-->
            <p class="para">Our training is broken up into four distinct units: physical, mental, systems, and zero gravity. 
            In order to pass each unit, all future explorers must pass the unit test. After the completion of all
            training activities, future explorers must pass a comprehensive exam to gain flight clearance.</p>
                
            <h2 class="heads">Physical Training</h2>
            <p class="stacked-para">During the physical training unit, future explorers will spend time exercising. Space travel is physically
            demanding, requiring the astronaut to stay in peak physical condition in order to carry necessary equipment. In addition,
            space is unpredictable. If for any reason the needs arises, explorers should be physically capable of doing
            any task required of them such as taking long spacewalks or carrying large amounts of equipment.</p>
            <p class="stacked-para">The physical unit test consists of a mile run, pushups, crunches, and a one hundred meter freestyle swim.</p>
            <img class="" src="https://codehs.com/uploads/de8d494454b34b44822a33ee19e1c599" alt="Picture of Physical Training">
                
            <h2 class="heads">Mental Training</h2>
            <p class="stacked-para">Space requires astronauts to be quick on their feet, coming up with solutions in high-pressure situations. In order to ensure
            our explorers are up to the challenge, the mental stage of training teaches all future explorers about stress and various 
            coping mechanisms to help deal with it. Our mental training also teaches future explorers skills such as problem solving and 
            communication skills to help with the high-intensity of teamwork in space.</p>
            <p class="stacked-para">The mental unit test is a simulated problem in a spacecraft in which future explorers must figure out a way to solve their problem—
            and survive—before time and oxygen run out.</p>
            <img class="" src="https://codehs.com/uploads/e3dbc140fbd06aa98da3b0647e5d768d" alt="Picture of Mental Training">
                
            <h2 class="heads">Systems Training</h2>
            <p class="stacked-para">The systems training unit is where future explorers learn about the equipment they will be using during their journey.
            Everything from space suits to the toilet requires a certain level of knowledge to operate. The systems unit focuses on
            spacesuits, landers, and rovers since these are the three pieces of equipment our future explorers will be using
            the most.</p>
            <p class="stacked-para">The systems training unit concludes with a comprehensive multiple choice test that ensures all astronauts
            have the knowledge necessary to operate their equipment safely and effectively.</p>
            <img class="" src="https://codehs.com/uploads/4cd9616a1dae17d3fa4569749d32a8ed" alt="Picture of Systems Training">
                
            <h2 class="heads">Zero Gravity Training</h2>
            <p class="stacked-para">As most of our explorers time is spent in space, an environment with no gravity, our future explorers must be
            comfortable working in little to no gravity. Becuase gravity is present everywhere on Earth, our explorers train in water,
            a fluid that helps to simulate zero gravity environments. The unit exam for the zero gravity unit is a series of five exercises
            mimicing possile events in space, such as a crash landing or loss of pressure, completed over the course of three days.</p>
            <img class="" src="https://codehs.com/uploads/df9f2fbf7596c14eabf6d29a4b718a91" alt="Picture of Zero Gravity Training">
                
            <h2 class="heads">Comprehensive Training Exam</h2>
            <p class="stacked-para">The comprehensive exam is a four hour exam taking place in a simulated space environment. From launch to landing, the exam 
            covers it all. Various issues will appear that will need to be solved using the skills learned during training. During the exam all trainees will
            be monitored. Any error in procedure will result in a slight deduction of points. If a participant reaches less than seventy-five percent of total points,
            they will fail the exam. If at any point a fatal error occurs, one or more participants will fail the exam, depending on the error and who had an 
            opportunity interject.</p>
            <p class="stacked-para">If a trainee fails the comprehensive exam, they will be given two opportunities to take the exam again. Each retake will
            follow the same procedure as the first. After three fails, the trainee will be removed from the program. After removal, customers can appeal for
            readmission to the Excapade Galatica family. Appeals will be heard. Readmission is given on a case-by-case basis and is not guaranteed.</p>

            <p class="para">Once future explorers gain flight clearance through the comprehensive training exam, the skies—or rather the stars—are the limit!</p>

                <h2 class="heads">Disclaimer</h2>
                <p class="para">If at any point during the training process a physical, mental, or other problem comes to light that will prevent a future explorer from
                safely completing training or carrying out a required task during the explorer's expidition, he or she will be removed from the program.
                Refunds are given on a case-by-case basis as the equipment already purchased for the explorer's journey varies.</p>
